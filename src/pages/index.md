## An opiniated Eleventy starter

Based on the companion website of [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/)'s talk 'Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager'.
This approach promotes modern CSS with methodologies, fluid type & Space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement.

This starter really just exists to hopefully spread the use of this excellent workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with cube.fyi, utopia.fyi and every-layout.dev.
